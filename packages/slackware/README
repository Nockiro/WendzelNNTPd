WendzelNNTPd is an IPv6-ready Usenet server (NNTP daemon) with the
main goal to maximize usability on the console level. WendzelNNTPd
achieves this by breaking down complicated things into an easy-to-use
configuration file and tool. The server is portable (Linux/*BSD/
*nix), supports AUTHINFO authentication, contains support for Access
Control Lists (ACL), Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and supports
invisible newsgroups. It currently supports MySQL and SQLite backends.

Note: This package is compiled without MYSQL support and uses
      sqlite3 instead. Also, it requires flex, bison and libmhash. All
      these packages are contained in the standard Slackware Linux
      distribution.
      
      If you want to use MySQL instead of sqlite3, remove the
      "MYSQL=NO" before ./configure in wendzelnntpd.Slackbuild.
      
      If you have any questions / found any bugs, please let me know so
      that I can improve this package (see https://www.wendzel.de for
      contact details).
