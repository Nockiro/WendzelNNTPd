# WendzelNNTPd

**WendzelNNTPd** is an IPv6-ready Usenet server (NNTP daemon) with the main goal to maximize usability on the console level. WendzelNNTPd achieves this by breaking down complicated things into an easy-to-use configuration file and tool. The server is portable (Linux/*BSD/*nix), supports AUTHINFO authentication, contains support for Access Control Lists (ACL), Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and supports invisible newsgroups. It currently supports MySQL and SQLite backends.
