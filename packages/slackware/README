WendzelNNTPd is an easy to configure Usenet server (NNTP daemon).
WendzelNNTPd breaks down complicated things into an easy-to-use
configuration file and tool. The server is portable (Linux/*BSD/
*nix), supports IPv4 and IPv6, AUTHINFO authentication, contains
support for Access Control Lists (ACL), Role-based Access Control
(RBAC) and supports invisible newsgroups. It currently supports
MySQL and SQLite backends.

Note: This package is compiled without MYSQL support and uses
      sqlite3 instead.
      If you want to use MySQL instead of sqlite3, remove the
      "MYSQL=NO" before ./configure in wendzelnntpd.Slackbuild.
